  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Panacea will help you to start working directly in the business logic of your app. Removing the pain of integrating some of the most common gems by asking you if you want to do so.</p>
  <p>What usually takes at least 2 hours of your work day, you can get it achieved in less than 2 minutes.</p>
  <p>Panacea uses Rails Templates and Thor actions to do it’s magic.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Panacea support most of the Rails arguments, feel free to use them to tweak how your Rails app is generated.</p>
  <p>You can see the complete list of accepted arguments with the following command:</p>
  <code>$ panacea --help</code>
  <p>The most important argument is the database to use. Panacea works without it, but it assume that the default will be postgresql.</p>
  <code>$ panacea my-app</code>
  <p>The previous command will create a Rails app that uses Postgres as its database.</p>
  <p>Be aware that if you want to use a different database, you should pass the Rails argument to do so:</p>
  <code>$ panacea my-app --database=mysql</code>

  <h2>What other gems can Panacea configure for me?</h2>
  <p>This section will list the settings or gems that Panacea can configure for you. Panacea does it though the following questions:</p>
  <h3>Which framework do you want to use in your tests?</h3>
  <p>Here you can choose between minitest or rspec. Panacea will update your app’s test environment to use the tool that you chose.</p>
  <h3>What should be the minimum coverage expected by Simplecov?</h3>
  <p>Here you can enter a value between 0 a 100. 80 is the default value and it will be used if you hit the return key.</p>
  <p>It will create the test/support/simplecov.rb or spec/support/simplecov.rb file (based on what you chose in the previous question). In that file you should be able to customize your Coverage settings if you want.</p>
  <p>Panacea only sets the setting: SimpleCov.minimum_coverage with the value you entered.</p>
  <h3>Do you want to setup FactoryBot for your tests?</h3>
  <p>Here you will be able to tell Panacea to setup FactoryBot for you. Default answer is no.</p>

  <h3>Do you want to setup Headless Chrome as default driver for System Tests?</h3>
  <p>By default Rails apps open a Chrome browser to run the system tests. Here you will be able to setup your Rails apps to work with a Headless Chrome driver. Useful if you want to run your system tests on a CI environment. Default answer is no.</p>
  <h3>Do you want to setup Dotenv to manage ENV variables in development?</h3>

  <p>For any option except none, Panacea will run the rake task provided by the gem to setup the framework of your choice.</p>
  <h3>Do you want to setup Devise to handle users in your app?</h3>

  <h3>Please choose your app's default time zone</h3>
  <p>One of the most common mistakes is to never set up your app’s default time zone. Please select one option, the list contains all the zones supported by Rails. The recommended is UTC but we know that all apps are unique. This will add a config setting on your config/application.rb file.</p>
  <h3>Please choose your app's default locale</h3>

  <h4>Which Git hook do you want to add?</h4>
  <p>If you answered yes to the previous question then you can choose what git hook to configure, the options are pre-commit or pre-push. Both git hooks run Rubocop to find any style issues and also run the test suite via the bundle exec rake to ensure all tests pass.</p>
