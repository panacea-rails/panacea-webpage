Hey there! It's been a couple of days since we released the very first version of [Panacea](https://rubygems.org/gems/panacea-rails). We are really excited about this project, because we believe in it.

We want that Panacea becomes your primary tool when generating new Rails apps.

In this release, we focused on you expending less time. How will you achieve this? Easy, run the command, select the gems that you want or plan to use and give it a few secs.

After Panacea finishes its work, you'll get a Rails application completely ready to start working on what really matters to you: **your app's business logic**!

Give it a shot, and if you have any suggestion, please open an issue on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/panacea-rails/panacea/issues)
